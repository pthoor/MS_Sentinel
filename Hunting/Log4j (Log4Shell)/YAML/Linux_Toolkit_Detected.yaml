name: Possible Linux attack toolkit detected via Syslog data
description: |
  'This query uses syslog data to alert on any attack toolkits associated with massive scanning or exploitation attempts against a known vulnerability.
  Attackers may perform such operations as seen recently to exploit the remote code execution vulnerability in Log4j component of Apache to scope and prioritize post-compromise objectives.
